/**
 * The SetPoint object is used to apply specific temperature set points to a temperature control device. The values of the heatingSetpoint and coolingSetpoint attributes SHALL be calculated as follows:
 * Cooling/Heating Temperature Set Point / 100 = temperature in degrees Celsius where -273.15°C &lt;= temperature &lt;= 327.67°C, corresponding to a Cooling and/or Heating Temperature Set Point. The maximum resolution this format allows is 0.01°C. 
 * The field not present in a Response indicates that this field has not been used by the end device. 
 * If a temperature is sent that exceeds the temperature limit boundaries that are programmed into the device, the device SHALL respond by setting the temperature at the limit.
 *
